2. **Memory allocation overhead** - Constant malloc/free operations
3. **Inefficient task distribution** - No work stealing mechanism
4. **Suboptimal worker counts** - Not tuned to system capabilities
5. **Lack of performance monitoring** - Couldn't identify bottlenecks

### **Solution Implementation (After)**
1. **Advanced load balancing** - Dynamic workload distribution
2. **Memory pooling** - Eliminated allocation overhead
3. **Work stealing** - Idle workers steal from busy ones
4. **Optimized worker counts** - Tuned to system capabilities
5. **Real-time monitoring** - Continuous performance optimization
